        // This optimization is *crucial* for performance: for

        // WF(?0: SliceExt)`.  This causes us to **enumerate all types
        // `?0` that where `Slice<?0>` normalizes to `!1` -- this is
        // an infinite set of types, effectively. Interestingly,
        // though, we only need one and we are done, because (if you
        // look) our goal (`!1: Clone`) doesn't have any output
        // parameters.
        //
        // This is actually a kind of general case. Due to Rust's rule
        // about constrained impl type parameters, generally speaking
        // when we have some free inference variable (like `?0`)
        // within our clause, it must appear in the head of the
        // clause. This means that the values we create for it will
        // propagate up to the caller, and they will quickly surmise
        // that there is ambiguity and stop requesting more answers.
        // Indeed, the only exception to this rule about constrained
        // type parameters if with associated type projections, as in
        // the case above!
        //
        // (Actually, because of the trivial answer cut off rule, we
        // never even get to the point of asking the query above in
        // `projection_from_env_slow`.)
        //
        // However, there is one fly in the ointment: answers include
        // region constraints, and you might imagine that we could
        // find future answers that are also trivial but with distinct
        // sets of region constraints. **For this reason, we only
        // apply this green cut rule if the set of generated
        // constraints is empty.**
        //
        // The limitation on region constraints is quite a drag! We
        // can probably do better, though: for example, coherence
        // guarantees that, for any given set of types, only a single
        // impl ought to be applicable, and that impl can only impose
        // one set of region constraints. However, it's not quite that
        // simple, thanks to specialization as well as the possibility
        // of proving things from the environment (though the latter
        // is a *bit* suspect; e.g., those things in the environment
